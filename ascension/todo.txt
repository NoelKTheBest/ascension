To Do:

I need to refactor the code in Grid.gd to be able toget the shape size in pixels of a block and 
generate a new grid of positions based on the blocks size. I would like to be able to change the 
size of the block if desired just by changing either the scale of the CollisionShape or the size
of the shape in the block scene
