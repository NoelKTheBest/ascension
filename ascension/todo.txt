To Do:

- Add camera to scene and update position when the player is moved upwards 
	on the screen. player dies when they are no longer visible in the 
	viewport

- Set Player position accordingly to how blocks will interact with them

- move block movement logic into Block.gd only if a better relationship can 
	be established between Block.gd and Game.gd

- Add a Grid Query method for finding the closest row/column, and another
	method for finding the next available open space if a block is 
	blocking the path

- Add a Grid Manipulation method for activating a block upon collision
	with the new block and make the previously static block active again
