To Do:

- Create a visible on screen grid

- Update Game.gd to check adjacent rows and columns

- Add camera to scene and update position when the player is moved upwards on the screen. 
	player dies when they are no longer visible in the viewport

- Set Player position accordingly to how blocks will interact with them

- move block movement logic into Block.gd only if a better relationship can be established between
	Block.gd and Game.gd
